1. Conventions

1.1. All private symbols with external linkage are prefixed with Gc_ to avoid 
conflic with user symbols.

1.2. All public symbols are prefixed with Gc.

1.3. All compound types are prefixed with T.

1.4. All simple types have _t suffix.

1.3. Data with external linkage is groupped in as few as possible (taking
design and aesthetics considretaions into account) structures with a 
"_public" suffix. 

For example the shared data of an internal module 
called PageHeap should be combined into a structure called Gc_TPageHeap_public. 
The only instance of the structure should be called Gc_PageHeap_public or
Gc_PH for short.

Since there will be only once instance of the structure and it is with external
linkage, it should be declared in this way int a header:

extern struct Gc_TPageHeap_public
{
} Gc_PH;

1.4. Internal defines need not follow any conventions since they are visible
only inside the GC library.

1.5. All filenames must be prefixed with gc or gc_ to avoid conflicts with
user filenames, especially of the collector is linked as a library (in that
case the user modules could silently replace modules from the collector).
